A
Spanish
court
dismissed
Friday
a
new
complaint
filed
in
2020
against
Barcelona's
Lionel
Messi
by
a
man
who
accuses
the
Argentine
footballer
of
fraud

embezzlement
and
money
laundering

Federico
Rettori

an
Argentine
national
living
in
Spain
who
claims
he
formerly
worked
for
Messi's
charity

had
filed
a
similar
complaint
in
2019
which
was
also
dismissed

In
it
he
claimed
that
funds
received
by
the
foundation
which
should
have
been
directed
to
social
causes
instead
went
towards
various
private
activities
or
bank
accounts
that
differed
from
those
that
were
declared
by
the
foundation


In
the
complaint
Rettori
filed
in
2020
he
again
named
the
Barcelona
striker

the
charity

his
father
Jorge
and
brother
Rodrigo

and
added
more
documents
to
try
to
back
his
claims


But
Spain's
National
Court
said
in
its
ruling
that
after
two
years
of
investigating
no
criminal
act
on
the
part
of
the
people
targeted
by
the
complaint
could
be
proven


The
court
also
said
Rettori
was
never
employed
by
Messi's
foundation


Instead
he
headed
an
association
called
El
Buen
Camino

or
The
Right
Path

which
received
150
000
euros
($177
000)
in
2014
and
2015
to
fight
infant
mortality
in
Sierra
Leone

the
court
said


This
project
was
aborted
due
to
an
Ebola
epidemic
in
the
West
African
country
